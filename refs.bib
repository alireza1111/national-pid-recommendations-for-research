  abstract = {The current landscape around persistent identifiers (PIDs) keeps quickly evolving. Some PIDs like Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for publications and datasets or ORCIDs (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) for persistent author identification are already well-established, but there is also a whole additional range of emerging identifiers in the research area, often being implemented under competing approaches. These include among others identifiers for organisations (OrgIDs), for research grants (grantIDs), and projects (RAIDs), for research equipment and facilities (PIDINSTs) and for physical samples (IGSNs). This is then a timely moment to explore the risks and trust-related issues associated with an ever wider implementation of PIDs. Following an earlier work on `risks and trust in pursuit of a well-functioning Persistent Identifier infrastructure for research' conducted by the Knowledge Exchange (KE) Task \& Finish Group on PIDs, the KE commissioned a study in July 2021 to look deeper into these issues. This work, undertaken by the signatories of this paper, will result in the publication of a report and a series of case studies on specific areas of current PID development. At the time the CRIS2022 Conference takes place the work is still underway, but already advanced enough to describe its methodology, early findings, landscape analysis and early recommendations. The full project results are expected to be published by the KE by the end of 2022.},

  abstract = {Persistent identifiers (PIDs) provide unique and long-lasting references to entities. They enable unique identification persistently over time and hence play a crucial role in supporting the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. In this paper, we describe how the benefits of PIDs can be amplified by connecting them via their metadata. We are introducing the next step in PID infrastructure: the PID Graph. The PID Graph establishes connections between different entities within the research landscape, thereby enabling both researchers and institutions to access new information. The paper closes with three recommendations, which will help to optimize the use and value of PIDs within the research ecosystem.},

The investigation set out to analyse the current state of the Persistent Identifier (PID) landscape in the six Knowledge Exchange partner countries and beyond, taking emerging PIDs particularly into account and examining the roles of relevant stakeholders as PID service providers, higher education institutions, researchers, publishers and national libraries.~ The report examines the PID landscape and provides a detailed look at what can go wrong with an unreliable PID service. In addition, a series of recommendations aimed at each stakeholder group are presented. Seven complementary case studies accompany the report, helping provide a deeper insight into specific areas of activity, workflows and stakeholders within this wider PID landscape. Each can be accessed through the report.},

  abstract = {The main topic of this report concerns the formulation of guidelines for PID Managers regarding the creation of a ``user tailored EOSC compliant PID policy.'' Central to the work are the following questions. How can we determine the quality of the EOSC PID policy and - in collaboration with all stakeholders - how can we implement a user tailored PID policy? In other words, what principles, roles and criteria can we distinguish when it comes to the use of PIDs in the EOSC. To answer this question, we need to thoroughly and systematically analyze the PID landscape (of which PID Managers are a part). For this, we are working closely with the FAIRCORE4EOSC project in which a Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT) is being developed. The CAT will support PID Managers and others with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. In total 16 guidelines for formulating PID policies are compiled and presented in the report. On this basis, targeted support can be provided for the formulation of EOSC compliant PID policies as provided by the FAIR-IMPACT project.},
