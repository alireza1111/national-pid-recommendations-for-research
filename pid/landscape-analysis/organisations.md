# Organisations

With the rapid digitisation of the research sector, unambigous identification of organisations have emerged as one of the most important use cases for PIDs.

Examples of organisations benefitting from being identified with PIDs include:

* Universities and colleges
* Research institutes
* Hospitals performing research
* Government agencies performing research
* Commercial entities performing research
* Research funders
* Organisations providing research infrastructures
* Registries and other data providers

Identifying organisations with PIDs serve several core needs in the research ecosystem such as providing information on:

* Affiliations of researchers and other contributors
* Legal responsibilities and accountability
* Funding sources
* Provenance of data and other materials
* Individual parties to agreements
* etc.

Since research information is often subject to large-scale automated processing, the existence or absence of an unambigous organisational PID may in many cases affect critical processes. An example of this is affiliational metadata, affecting scientometric analyses, research assessment, indicators and rankings.

## International PIDs and identifiers

### ROR ID
Since 2019, the Research Organisation Registry maintains [ROR ID](../data-on-pids/ror.md), which serves as an international registry and PID for organisations associated with the research lifecycle.

It has quickly developed into a PID system in widespread use by core actors and systems such as publishers, funders, grant trackers, data repositories, CRIS systems and many others. 

ROR is maintained as a collaborative initiative by Crossref, DataCite and the California Digital Library. The assignment of ROR IDs and metadata contents is handled through active curation on Github taking external suggestions into account, and new releases of the registry are published in rapid intervals.

Since 2021, ROR has incorporated entities formerly assigned a GRID ID, formally superseding it as a PID system.
